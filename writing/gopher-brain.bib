    abstract = {Previous studies focusing on the temporal rules governing changes in synaptic strength during spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP) have paid little attention to the fact that synaptic inputs are distributed across complex dendritic trees. During STDP, propagation of action potentials (APs) back to the site of synaptic input is thought to trigger plasticity. However, in pyramidal neurons, backpropagation of single APs is decremental, whereas high-frequency bursts lead to generation of distal dendritic calcium spikes. This raises the question whether STDP learning rules depend on synapse location and firing mode. Here, we investigate this issue at synapses between layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons in somatosensory cortex. We find that low-frequency pairing of single APs at positive times leads to a distance-dependent shift to long-term depression (LTD) at distal inputs. At proximal sites, this LTD could be converted to long-term potentiation (LTP) by dendritic depolarizations suprathreshold for BAC-firing or by high-frequency AP bursts. During AP bursts, we observed a progressive, distance-dependent shift in the timing requirements for induction of LTP and LTD, such that distal synapses display novel timing rules: they potentiate when inputs are activated after burst onset (negative timing) but depress when activated before burst onset (positive timing). These findings could be explained by distance-dependent differences in the underlying dendritic voltage waveforms driving NMDA receptor activation during STDP induction. Our results suggest that synapse location within the dendritic tree is a crucial determinant of STDP, and that synapses undergo plasticity according to local rather than global learning rules.},

    abstract = {The formation of new synapses has been suggested to underlie learning and memory. However, previous work from this laboratory has demonstrated that hippocampus-dependent associative learning does not induce a net gain in the total number of hippocampal synapses and, hence, a net synaptogenesis. The aim of the present work was to determine whether associative learning involves a specific synaptogenesis confined to the formation of multiple-synapse boutons (MSBs) that synapse with more than one dendritic spine. We used the behavioral paradigm of trace eyeblink conditioning, which is a hippocampus-dependent form of associative learning. Conditioned rabbits were given daily 80-trial sessions to a criterion of 80\\% conditioned responses in a session. During each trial, the conditioned stimulus (tone) and the unconditioned stimulus (corneal airpuff) were presented with an intervening trace interval of 500 msec. Brain tissue was taken for morphological analyses 24 hr after the last session. Unbiased stereological methods were used for obtaining estimates of the total number of MSBs in the stratum radiatum of hippocampal subfield CA1. The results showed that the total number of MSBs was significantly increased in conditioned rabbits as compared with pseudoconditioned or unstimulated controls. This conditioning-induced change, which occurs without a net synaptogenesis, reflects a specific synaptogenesis resulting in MSB formation. Models of the latter process are proposed. The models postulate that it requires spine motility and may involve the relocation of existing spines from nonactivated boutons or the outgrowth of newly formed spines for specific synaptogenesis with single-synapse boutons activated by the conditioning stimulation.},
